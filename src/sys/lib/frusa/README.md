Fast RUst System Allocator

## What is it?

Another implementation of core::alloc::GlobalAlloc (Rust)

## Why?

A system allocator should be reasonably fast, should be able to request more memory,
and allow memory reclaim. I needed one at the beginning of 2023, and at this time
none of the allocators I could find on crates.io matched the requirements.

## Goals

- fast and efficient alloc/dealloc of small memory chunks
- no-std
- can be used as ```#[GlobalAllocator]```
- relatively easy and efficient expansion/reclaim

## Non goals

- don't care about large memory chunks: this is punted to the back-end allocator
- being the fastest possible allocator is not the goal at the moment; relatively
  low overhead and efficient reclaim are more important

## So is it fast? Ready to use?

- not as fast as malloc or kernel slabs at the moment, but still decent
- reclaim works (on demand)
- tested on x64
- NOT tested on arm64 or other architectures

## A simple benchmark

```
$ cargo test --release concurrent_speed_test -- --nocapture
