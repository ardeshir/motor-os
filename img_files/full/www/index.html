<h1>Motor OS</h1>

<p>Motūrus project (Motor OS) is a simple, fast, and secure operating system built for the cloud.
Designed specifically for virtualized workloads such as web serving, serverless computing,
and edge caching, it addresses inefficiencies found in traditional operating systems
like Linux when running in virtual environments.</p>

<p>Motor OS is built entirely in Rust. It supports x64 KVM-based virtual machines
and can run on Qemu, Cloud Hypervisor, or Alioth VMMs. The system, including
its libraries and syscalls, is implemented in Rust and optimized for Rust-based client applications.</p>
